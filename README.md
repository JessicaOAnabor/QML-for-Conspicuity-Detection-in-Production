### Project Solution:

### Step 1: Familiarization with PennyLane and JAX

Initially, you need to familiarize yourself with PennyLane and its integration with JAX. To do this:

Review the documentation and tutorial materials for PennyLane and JAX.
Implement and present the PennyLane x JAX tutorial.

### Step 2: Implementing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)

We will tackle Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) with different scaling approaches. In this step:

Develop QNN prototypes using PennyLane and JAX.
Present the results using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) and visualization techniques.

### Step 3: Benchmarking Against Classical Methods

Finally, we will compare the performance of hybrid quantum algorithms with classical machine learning and statistical methods:

Benchmark the hybrid quantum algorithms against classical methods.
Visualize and compare the performance metrics.

### Dataset
We will be using the Detecting Anomalies in Wafer Production dataset as another implementation for Task 3 (QNNs). This unique dataset is crucial as the semiconductor industry is heavily invested in improving wafer production processes, positioning our project at the forefront of advancements in this sector.

### Results

Detailed results and visualizations will be available in the results directory.
Standard metrics used for evaluation include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
